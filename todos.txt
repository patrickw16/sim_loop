-) instantiate github repo
-) scenario design -> cut-in scenario, what needs to be adapted?
    --> work with defined parameter distributions (based on OSC format, for GT generation)
-) finalize execution.py (with simple ACC, etc.)
-) work out usage in Google Colab - local usage including YOLO inference at runtime is not feasible
-) check for tracking option in ultralytics
    https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track/
-) look into parallel execution (esmini doc, 5.4.1)
    --> should be doable in principle
